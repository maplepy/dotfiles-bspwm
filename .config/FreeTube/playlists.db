It handles folders, you can favorite files and folders to get back to them easily, you can tag anything you like, you can share anything either with selected people, or with a public link, you can even add comments to any file, and it supports versioning as well to restore older versions if you want.\n\n\nOn top of that, you can also mount that storage as webdav, in any good file manager. On Linux, with GNOME and KDE, this happens automatically when you configure a nextcloud account in the online accounts settings.\n\nAnd of course, you have a desktop client that lets you sync files either from a Nextcloud folder, or even from outside that folder, to make sure your files are where you want them.\n\nSyncthing isn't exactly cloud storage, it doesn't store files on a cloud server, it just syncs them from one computer to the other, in real time. So you setup syncthing on your laptop and your desktop, and it will send files back and forth between both devices, without any intermediary in between.\n\nIf you're already a ProtonMail customer, you might just want to look at Proton Drive.\n\nIt's an end to end encrypted solution, hosted in Switzerland, with relatively strong privacy laws, that don't really matter since everything is encrypted anyways, it's not like someone could look at what you stored, since files are encrypted on your device before being sent to the cloud.\n\nIt's also open source, and it obviously integrates well with the other Proton tools, like Mail or Calendar. Even though it's encrypted, you can still share files with others without file size limits, as well as password protect files, define expiration dates for links, and more.\n\nAnother open source alternative is Cozy Cloud. It's available for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS and Windows, and it gives you 5GB for free, with additional tiers at 50Gigs for 2 euros 99 per month, and 1TB for 9 euros 98. Still more expensive than Google, but also more private.\n\nIt also has auto import features from your phone camera roll to your drive, and can also automatically import certain documents from more than 100 providers, like your bills, health refunds, bank statements, and more, if you want.\n\npCloud is an option I used extensively in the past for all my cloud storage. It's not open source, but it has optional encryption features if you want to make sure that you're the only one that can look at your stuff. They're on the affordable side, with 500Gigs costing you 50 euros per year, or about 4 euros per month, and 2 terabytes for 100 euros a year, or a bit more than 8 euros per month.\n\nIf what you need is massive storage space and you don't want to self host, then I think Mega is your only option. Their base plans are more expensive than others, at 5 euros per month for 400 Gigs, but they can go up to 16Tb for 30 euros per month, which is a LOT of storage for not that much money, considering. The 2TB plan is on par with other options, at 10 euros per month.\n\nAnd I can't conclude this video without mentioning Zoho. If you don't really care all that much about privacy or open source, but you still want to ditch big tech, then Zoho is probably your best bet. they have replacements for EVERYTHING google does, and a lot more on top of that, and prices are relatively inexpensive.","viewCount":49602,"lengthSeconds":930,"timeAdded":1675625398641,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"SlooBN-qxiI","title":"High & Fines Herbes -

It handles folders, you can favorite files and folders to get back to them easily, you can tag anything you like, you can share anything either with selected people, or with a public link, you can even add comments to any file, and it supports versioning as well to restore older versions if you want.\n\n\nOn top of that, you can also mount that storage as webdav, in any good file manager. On Linux, with GNOME and KDE, this happens automatically when you configure a nextcloud account in the online accounts settings.\n\nAnd of course, you have a desktop client that lets you sync files either from a Nextcloud folder, or even from outside that folder, to make sure your files are where you want them.\n\nSyncthing isn't exactly cloud storage, it doesn't store files on a cloud server, it just syncs them from one computer to the other, in real time. So you setup syncthing on your laptop and your desktop, and it will send files back and forth between both devices, without any intermediary in between.\n\nIf you're already a ProtonMail customer, you might just want to look at Proton Drive.\n\nIt's an end to end encrypted solution, hosted in Switzerland, with relatively strong privacy laws, that don't really matter since everything is encrypted anyways, it's not like someone could look at what you stored, since files are encrypted on your device before being sent to the cloud.\n\nIt's also open source, and it obviously integrates well with the other Proton tools, like Mail or Calendar. Even though it's encrypted, you can still share files with others without file size limits, as well as password protect files, define expiration dates for links, and more.\n\nAnother open source alternative is Cozy Cloud. It's available for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS and Windows, and it gives you 5GB for free, with additional tiers at 50Gigs for 2 euros 99 per month, and 1TB for 9 euros 98. Still more expensive than Google, but also more private.\n\nIt also has auto import features from your phone camera roll to your drive, and can also automatically import certain documents from more than 100 providers, like your bills, health refunds, bank statements, and more, if you want.\n\npCloud is an option I used extensively in the past for all my cloud storage. It's not open source, but it has optional encryption features if you want to make sure that you're the only one that can look at your stuff. They're on the affordable side, with 500Gigs costing you 50 euros per year, or about 4 euros per month, and 2 terabytes for 100 euros a year, or a bit more than 8 euros per month.\n\nIf what you need is massive storage space and you don't want to self host, then I think Mega is your only option. Their base plans are more expensive than others, at 5 euros per month for 400 Gigs, but they can go up to 16Tb for 30 euros per month, which is a LOT of storage for not that much money, considering. The 2TB plan is on par with other options, at 10 euros per month.\n\nAnd I can't conclude this video without mentioning Zoho. If you don't really care all that much about privacy or open source, but you still want to ditch big tech, then Zoho is probably your best bet. they have replacements for EVERYTHING google does, and a lot more on top of that, and prices are relatively inexpensive.","viewCount":49602,"lengthSeconds":930,"timeAdded":1675625398641,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"SlooBN-qxiI","title":"High & Fines Herbes -

It handles folders, you can favorite files and folders to get back to them easily, you can tag anything you like, you can share anything either with selected people, or with a public link, you can even add comments to any file, and it supports versioning as well to restore older versions if you want.\n\n\nOn top of that, you can also mount that storage as webdav, in any good file manager. On Linux, with GNOME and KDE, this happens automatically when you configure a nextcloud account in the online accounts settings.\n\nAnd of course, you have a desktop client that lets you sync files either from a Nextcloud folder, or even from outside that folder, to make sure your files are where you want them.\n\nSyncthing isn't exactly cloud storage, it doesn't store files on a cloud server, it just syncs them from one computer to the other, in real time. So you setup syncthing on your laptop and your desktop, and it will send files back and forth between both devices, without any intermediary in between.\n\nIf you're already a ProtonMail customer, you might just want to look at Proton Drive.\n\nIt's an end to end encrypted solution, hosted in Switzerland, with relatively strong privacy laws, that don't really matter since everything is encrypted anyways, it's not like someone could look at what you stored, since files are encrypted on your device before being sent to the cloud.\n\nIt's also open source, and it obviously integrates well with the other Proton tools, like Mail or Calendar. Even though it's encrypted, you can still share files with others without file size limits, as well as password protect files, define expiration dates for links, and more.\n\nAnother open source alternative is Cozy Cloud. It's available for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS and Windows, and it gives you 5GB for free, with additional tiers at 50Gigs for 2 euros 99 per month, and 1TB for 9 euros 98. Still more expensive than Google, but also more private.\n\nIt also has auto import features from your phone camera roll to your drive, and can also automatically import certain documents from more than 100 providers, like your bills, health refunds, bank statements, and more, if you want.\n\npCloud is an option I used extensively in the past for all my cloud storage. It's not open source, but it has optional encryption features if you want to make sure that you're the only one that can look at your stuff. They're on the affordable side, with 500Gigs costing you 50 euros per year, or about 4 euros per month, and 2 terabytes for 100 euros a year, or a bit more than 8 euros per month.\n\nIf what you need is massive storage space and you don't want to self host, then I think Mega is your only option. Their base plans are more expensive than others, at 5 euros per month for 400 Gigs, but they can go up to 16Tb for 30 euros per month, which is a LOT of storage for not that much money, considering. The 2TB plan is on par with other options, at 10 euros per month.\n\nAnd I can't conclude this video without mentioning Zoho. If you don't really care all that much about privacy or open source, but you still want to ditch big tech, then Zoho is probably your best bet. they have replacements for EVERYTHING google does, and a lot more on top of that, and prices are relatively inexpensive.","viewCount":49602,"lengthSeconds":930,"timeAdded":1675625398641,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"SlooBN-qxiI","title":"High & Fines Herbes -

On Linux, with GNOME and KDE, this happens automatically when you configure a nextcloud account in the online accounts settings.\n\nAnd of course, you have a desktop client that lets you sync files either from a Nextcloud folder, or even from outside that folder, to make sure your files are where you want them.\n\nSyncthing isn't exactly cloud storage, it doesn't store files on a cloud server, it just syncs them from one computer to the other, in real time. So you setup syncthing on your laptop and your desktop, and it will send files back and forth between both devices, without any intermediary in between.\n\nIf you're already a ProtonMail customer, you might just want to look at Proton Drive.\n\nIt's an end to end encrypted solution, hosted in Switzerland, with relatively strong privacy laws, that don't really matter since everything is encrypted anyways, it's not like someone could look at what you stored, since files are encrypted on your device before being sent to the cloud.\n\nIt's also open source, and it obviously integrates well with the other Proton tools, like Mail or Calendar. Even though it's encrypted, you can still share files with others without file size limits, as well as password protect files, define expiration dates for links, and more.\n\nAnother open source alternative is Cozy Cloud. It's available for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS and Windows, and it gives you 5GB for free, with additional tiers at 50Gigs for 2 euros 99 per month, and 1TB for 9 euros 98. Still more expensive than Google, but also more private.\n\nIt also has auto import features from your phone camera roll to your drive, and can also automatically import certain documents from more than 100 providers, like your bills, health refunds, bank statements, and more, if you want.\n\npCloud is an option I used extensively in the past for all my cloud storage. It's not open source, but it has optional encryption features if you want to make sure that you're the only one that can look at your stuff. They're on the affordable side, with 500Gigs costing you 50 euros per year, or about 4 euros per month, and 2 terabytes for 100 euros a year, or a bit more than 8 euros per month.\n\nIf what you need is massive storage space and you don't want to self host, then I think Mega is your only option. Their base plans are more expensive than others, at 5 euros per month for 400 Gigs, but they can go up to 16Tb for 30 euros per month, which is a LOT of storage for not that much money, considering. The 2TB plan is on par with other options, at 10 euros per month.\n\nAnd I can't conclude this video without mentioning Zoho. If you don't really care all that much about privacy or open source, but you still want to ditch big tech, then Zoho is probably your best bet. they have replacements for EVERYTHING google does, and a lot more on top of that, and prices are relatively inexpensive.","viewCount":49602,"lengthSeconds":930,"timeAdded":1675625398641,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"SlooBN-qxiI","title":"High & Fines Herbes -

It handles folders, you can favorite files and folders to get back to them easily, you can tag anything you like, you can share anything either with selected people, or with a public link, you can even add comments to any file, and it supports versioning as well to restore older versions if you want.\n\n\nOn top of that, you can also mount that storage as webdav, in any good file manager. On Linux, with GNOME and KDE, this happens automatically when you configure a nextcloud account in the online accounts settings.\n\nAnd of course, you have a desktop client that lets you sync files either from a Nextcloud folder, or even from outside that folder, to make sure your files are where you want them.\n\nSyncthing isn't exactly cloud storage, it doesn't store files on a cloud server, it just syncs them from one computer to the other, in real time. So you setup syncthing on your laptop and your desktop, and it will send files back and forth between both devices, without any intermediary in between.\n\nIf you're already a ProtonMail customer, you might just want to look at Proton Drive.\n\nIt's an end to end encrypted solution, hosted in Switzerland, with relatively strong privacy laws, that don't really matter since everything is encrypted anyways, it's not like someone could look at what you stored, since files are encrypted on your device before being sent to the cloud.\n\nIt's also open source, and it obviously integrates well with the other Proton tools, like Mail or Calendar. Even though it's encrypted, you can still share files with others without file size limits, as well as password protect files, define expiration dates for links, and more.\n\nAnother open source alternative is Cozy Cloud. It's available for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS and Windows, and it gives you 5GB for free, with additional tiers at 50Gigs for 2 euros 99 per month, and 1TB for 9 euros 98. Still more expensive than Google, but also more private.\n\nIt also has auto import features from your phone camera roll to your drive, and can also automatically import certain documents from more than 100 providers, like your bills, health refunds, bank statements, and more, if you want.\n\npCloud is an option I used extensively in the past for all my cloud storage. It's not open source, but it has optional encryption features if you want to make sure that you're the only one that can look at your stuff. They're on the affordable side, with 500Gigs costing you 50 euros per year, or about 4 euros per month, and 2 terabytes for 100 euros a year, or a bit more than 8 euros per month.\n\nIf what you need is massive storage space and you don't want to self host, then I think Mega is your only option. Their base plans are more expensive than others, at 5 euros per month for 400 Gigs, but they can go up to 16Tb for 30 euros per month, which is a LOT of storage for not that much money, considering. The 2TB plan is on par with other options, at 10 euros per month.\n\nAnd I can't conclude this video without mentioning Zoho. If you don't really care all that much about privacy or open source, but you still want to ditch big tech, then Zoho is probably your best bet. they have replacements for EVERYTHING google does, and a lot more on top of that, and prices are relatively inexpensive.","viewCount":49602,"lengthSeconds":930,"timeAdded":1675625398641,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"SlooBN-qxiI","title":"High & Fines Herbes -

It handles folders, you can favorite files and folders to get back to them easily, you can tag anything you like, you can share anything either with selected people, or with a public link, you can even add comments to any file, and it supports versioning as well to restore older versions if you want.\n\n\nOn top of that, you can also mount that storage as webdav, in any good file manager. On Linux, with GNOME and KDE, this happens automatically when you configure a nextcloud account in the online accounts settings.\n\nAnd of course, you have a desktop client that lets you sync files either from a Nextcloud folder, or even from outside that folder, to make sure your files are where you want them.\n\nSyncthing isn't exactly cloud storage, it doesn't store files on a cloud server, it just syncs them from one computer to the other, in real time. So you setup syncthing on your laptop and your desktop, and it will send files back and forth between both devices, without any intermediary in between.\n\nIf you're already a ProtonMail customer, you might just want to look at Proton Drive.\n\nIt's an end to end encrypted solution, hosted in Switzerland, with relatively strong privacy laws, that don't really matter since everything is encrypted anyways, it's not like someone could look at what you stored, since files are encrypted on your device before being sent to the cloud.\n\nIt's also open source, and it obviously integrates well with the other Proton tools, like Mail or Calendar. Even though it's encrypted, you can still share files with others without file size limits, as well as password protect files, define expiration dates for links, and more.\n\nAnother open source alternative is Cozy Cloud. It's available for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS and Windows, and it gives you 5GB for free, with additional tiers at 50Gigs for 2 euros 99 per month, and 1TB for 9 euros 98. Still more expensive than Google, but also more private.\n\nIt also has auto import features from your phone camera roll to your drive, and can also automatically import certain documents from more than 100 providers, like your bills, health refunds, bank statements, and more, if you want.\n\npCloud is an option I used extensively in the past for all my cloud storage. It's not open source, but it has optional encryption features if you want to make sure that you're the only one that can look at your stuff. They're on the affordable side, with 500Gigs costing you 50 euros per year, or about 4 euros per month, and 2 terabytes for 100 euros a year, or a bit more than 8 euros per month.\n\nIf what you need is massive storage space and you don't want to self host, then I think Mega is your only option. Their base plans are more expensive than others, at 5 euros per month for 400 Gigs, but they can go up to 16Tb for 30 euros per month, which is a LOT of storage for not that much money, considering. The 2TB plan is on par with other options, at 10 euros per month.\n\nAnd I can't conclude this video without mentioning Zoho. If you don't really care all that much about privacy or open source, but you still want to ditch big tech, then Zoho is probably your best bet. they have replacements for EVERYTHING google does, and a lot more on top of that, and prices are relatively inexpensive.","viewCount":49602,"lengthSeconds":930,"timeAdded":1675625398641,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"SlooBN-qxiI","title":"High & Fines Herbes -

It handles folders, you can favorite files and folders to get back to them easily, you can tag anything you like, you can share anything either with selected people, or with a public link, you can even add comments to any file, and it supports versioning as well to restore older versions if you want.\n\n\nOn top of that, you can also mount that storage as webdav, in any good file manager. On Linux, with GNOME and KDE, this happens automatically when you configure a nextcloud account in the online accounts settings.\n\nAnd of course, you have a desktop client that lets you sync files either from a Nextcloud folder, or even from outside that folder, to make sure your files are where you want them.\n\nSyncthing isn't exactly cloud storage, it doesn't store files on a cloud server, it just syncs them from one computer to the other, in real time. So you setup syncthing on your laptop and your desktop, and it will send files back and forth between both devices, without any intermediary in between.\n\nIf you're already a ProtonMail customer, you might just want to look at Proton Drive.\n\nIt's an end to end encrypted solution, hosted in Switzerland, with relatively strong privacy laws, that don't really matter since everything is encrypted anyways, it's not like someone could look at what you stored, since files are encrypted on your device before being sent to the cloud.\n\nIt's also open source, and it obviously integrates well with the other Proton tools, like Mail or Calendar. Even though it's encrypted, you can still share files with others without file size limits, as well as password protect files, define expiration dates for links, and more.\n\nAnother open source alternative is Cozy Cloud. It's available for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS and Windows, and it gives you 5GB for free, with additional tiers at 50Gigs for 2 euros 99 per month, and 1TB for 9 euros 98. Still more expensive than Google, but also more private.\n\nIt also has auto import features from your phone camera roll to your drive, and can also automatically import certain documents from more than 100 providers, like your bills, health refunds, bank statements, and more, if you want.\n\npCloud is an option I used extensively in the past for all my cloud storage. It's not open source, but it has optional encryption features if you want to make sure that you're the only one that can look at your stuff. They're on the affordable side, with 500Gigs costing you 50 euros per year, or about 4 euros per month, and 2 terabytes for 100 euros a year, or a bit more than 8 euros per month.\n\nIf what you need is massive storage space and you don't want to self host, then I think Mega is your only option. Their base plans are more expensive than others, at 5 euros per month for 400 Gigs, but they can go up to 16Tb for 30 euros per month, which is a LOT of storage for not that much money, considering. The 2TB plan is on par with other options, at 10 euros per month.\n\nAnd I can't conclude this video without mentioning Zoho. If you don't really care all that much about privacy or open source, but you still want to ditch big tech, then Zoho is probably your best bet. they have replacements for EVERYTHING google does, and a lot more on top of that, and prices are relatively inexpensive.","viewCount":49602,"lengthSeconds":930,"timeAdded":1675625398641,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"SlooBN-qxiI","title":"High & Fines Herbes -

It handles folders, you can favorite files and folders to get back to them easily, you can tag anything you like, you can share anything either with selected people, or with a public link, you can even add comments to any file, and it supports versioning as well to restore older versions if you want.\n\n\nOn top of that, you can also mount that storage as webdav, in any good file manager. On Linux, with GNOME and KDE, this happens automatically when you configure a nextcloud account in the online accounts settings.\n\nAnd of course, you have a desktop client that lets you sync files either from a Nextcloud folder, or even from outside that folder, to make sure your files are where you want them.\n\nSyncthing isn't exactly cloud storage, it doesn't store files on a cloud server, it just syncs them from one computer to the other, in real time. So you setup syncthing on your laptop and your desktop, and it will send files back and forth between both devices, without any intermediary in between.\n\nIf you're already a ProtonMail customer, you might just want to look at Proton Drive.\n\nIt's an end to end encrypted solution, hosted in Switzerland, with relatively strong privacy laws, that don't really matter since everything is encrypted anyways, it's not like someone could look at what you stored, since files are encrypted on your device before being sent to the cloud.\n\nIt's also open source, and it obviously integrates well with the other Proton tools, like Mail or Calendar. Even though it's encrypted, you can still share files with others without file size limits, as well as password protect files, define expiration dates for links, and more.\n\nAnother open source alternative is Cozy Cloud. It's available for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS and Windows, and it gives you 5GB for free, with additional tiers at 50Gigs for 2 euros 99 per month, and 1TB for 9 euros 98. Still more expensive than Google, but also more private.\n\nIt also has auto import features from your phone camera roll to your drive, and can also automatically import certain documents from more than 100 providers, like your bills, health refunds, bank statements, and more, if you want.\n\npCloud is an option I used extensively in the past for all my cloud storage. It's not open source, but it has optional encryption features if you want to make sure that you're the only one that can look at your stuff. They're on the affordable side, with 500Gigs costing you 50 euros per year, or about 4 euros per month, and 2 terabytes for 100 euros a year, or a bit more than 8 euros per month.\n\nIf what you need is massive storage space and you don't want to self host, then I think Mega is your only option. Their base plans are more expensive than others, at 5 euros per month for 400 Gigs, but they can go up to 16Tb for 30 euros per month, which is a LOT of storage for not that much money, considering. The 2TB plan is on par with other options, at 10 euros per month.\n\nAnd I can't conclude this video without mentioning Zoho. If you don't really care all that much about privacy or open source, but you still want to ditch big tech, then Zoho is probably your best bet. they have replacements for EVERYTHING google does, and a lot more on top of that, and prices are relatively inexpensive.","viewCount":49602,"lengthSeconds":930,"timeAdded":1675625398641,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"SlooBN-qxiI","title":"High & Fines Herbes -

It handles folders, you can favorite files and folders to get back to them easily, you can tag anything you like, you can share anything either with selected people, or with a public link, you can even add comments to any file, and it supports versioning as well to restore older versions if you want.\n\n\nOn top of that, you can also mount that storage as webdav, in any good file manager. On Linux, with GNOME and KDE, this happens automatically when you configure a nextcloud account in the online accounts settings.\n\nAnd of course, you have a desktop client that lets you sync files either from a Nextcloud folder, or even from outside that folder, to make sure your files are where you want them.\n\nSyncthing isn't exactly cloud storage, it doesn't store files on a cloud server, it just syncs them from one computer to the other, in real time. So you setup syncthing on your laptop and your desktop, and it will send files back and forth between both devices, without any intermediary in between.\n\nIf you're already a ProtonMail customer, you might just want to look at Proton Drive.\n\nIt's an end to end encrypted solution, hosted in Switzerland, with relatively strong privacy laws, that don't really matter since everything is encrypted anyways, it's not like someone could look at what you stored, since files are encrypted on your device before being sent to the cloud.\n\nIt's also open source, and it obviously integrates well with the other Proton tools, like Mail or Calendar. Even though it's encrypted, you can still share files with others without file size limits, as well as password protect files, define expiration dates for links, and more.\n\nAnother open source alternative is Cozy Cloud. It's available for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS and Windows, and it gives you 5GB for free, with additional tiers at 50Gigs for 2 euros 99 per month, and 1TB for 9 euros 98. Still more expensive than Google, but also more private.\n\nIt also has auto import features from your phone camera roll to your drive, and can also automatically import certain documents from more than 100 providers, like your bills, health refunds, bank statements, and more, if you want.\n\npCloud is an option I used extensively in the past for all my cloud storage. It's not open source, but it has optional encryption features if you want to make sure that you're the only one that can look at your stuff. They're on the affordable side, with 500Gigs costing you 50 euros per year, or about 4 euros per month, and 2 terabytes for 100 euros a year, or a bit more than 8 euros per month.\n\nIf what you need is massive storage space and you don't want to self host, then I think Mega is your only option. Their base plans are more expensive than others, at 5 euros per month for 400 Gigs, but they can go up to 16Tb for 30 euros per month, which is a LOT of storage for not that much money, considering. The 2TB plan is on par with other options, at 10 euros per month.\n\nAnd I can't conclude this video without mentioning Zoho. If you don't really care all that much about privacy or open source, but you still want to ditch big tech, then Zoho is probably your best bet. they have replacements for EVERYTHING google does, and a lot more on top of that, and prices are relatively inexpensive.","viewCount":49602,"lengthSeconds":930,"timeAdded":1675625398641,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"SlooBN-qxiI","title":"High & Fines Herbes -

It handles folders, you can favorite files and folders to get back to them easily, you can tag anything you like, you can share anything either with selected people, or with a public link, you can even add comments to any file, and it supports versioning as well to restore older versions if you want.\n\n\nOn top of that, you can also mount that storage as webdav, in any good file manager. On Linux, with GNOME and KDE, this happens automatically when you configure a nextcloud account in the online accounts settings.\n\nAnd of course, you have a desktop client that lets you sync files either from a Nextcloud folder, or even from outside that folder, to make sure your files are where you want them.\n\nSyncthing isn't exactly cloud storage, it doesn't store files on a cloud server, it just syncs them from one computer to the other, in real time. So you setup syncthing on your laptop and your desktop, and it will send files back and forth between both devices, without any intermediary in between.\n\nIf you're already a ProtonMail customer, you might just want to look at Proton Drive.\n\nIt's an end to end encrypted solution, hosted in Switzerland, with relatively strong privacy laws, that don't really matter since everything is encrypted anyways, it's not like someone could look at what you stored, since files are encrypted on your device before being sent to the cloud.\n\nIt's also open source, and it obviously integrates well with the other Proton tools, like Mail or Calendar. Even though it's encrypted, you can still share files with others without file size limits, as well as password protect files, define expiration dates for links, and more.\n\nAnother open source alternative is Cozy Cloud. It's available for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS and Windows, and it gives you 5GB for free, with additional tiers at 50Gigs for 2 euros 99 per month, and 1TB for 9 euros 98. Still more expensive than Google, but also more private.\n\nIt also has auto import features from your phone camera roll to your drive, and can also automatically import certain documents from more than 100 providers, like your bills, health refunds, bank statements, and more, if you want.\n\npCloud is an option I used extensively in the past for all my cloud storage. It's not open source, but it has optional encryption features if you want to make sure that you're the only one that can look at your stuff. They're on the affordable side, with 500Gigs costing you 50 euros per year, or about 4 euros per month, and 2 terabytes for 100 euros a year, or a bit more than 8 euros per month.\n\nIf what you need is massive storage space and you don't want to self host, then I think Mega is your only option. Their base plans are more expensive than others, at 5 euros per month for 400 Gigs, but they can go up to 16Tb for 30 euros per month, which is a LOT of storage for not that much money, considering. The 2TB plan is on par with other options, at 10 euros per month.\n\nAnd I can't conclude this video without mentioning Zoho. If you don't really care all that much about privacy or open source, but you still want to ditch big tech, then Zoho is probably your best bet. they have replacements for EVERYTHING google does, and a lot more on top of that, and prices are relatively inexpensive.","viewCount":49602,"lengthSeconds":930,"timeAdded":1675625398641,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"SlooBN-qxiI","title":"High & Fines Herbes - Saison 4 - √âpisode 5 : Le sobeuhlier (avec Senamo, Di-meh, Youv Dee & Slimka)","author":"Caballero & JeanJass","authorId":"UCeg0PVLfsBKFLGd9V_EvbGA","published":"","viewCount":423093,"lengthSeconds":3332,"timeAdded":1677515265930,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"ReO9KD4QM_I","title":"5 lessons I learned in my early 20s (also, i moved!!)","author":"harshibar","authorId":"UCsp_z4KR3dOczXw7Q-SPqQg","published":"","viewCount":918,"lengthSeconds":513,"timeAdded":1677627540873,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"l9LQEHYr3AI","title":"The most useful Networking tool ever - Netcat","author":"Mark McNally","authorId":"UCMiInY8BhSUtCarO6uu6i_g","published":"","viewCount":99,"lengthSeconds":299,"timeAdded":1677627543733,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"zpcI_g_zrpk","title":"Why kids don‚Äôt get as cold as adults","author":"Vox","authorId":"UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA","published":"","viewCount":130085,"lengthSeconds":307,"timeAdded":1677627557859,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"nmNx1QqXpzM","title":"Lirik plays My Dream Setup","author":"waydong91","authorId":"UCebh6Np0l-DT9LXHrXbmopg","published":"","viewCount":2112,"lengthSeconds":1764,"timeAdded":1677627568206,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"25wG173PL3U","title":"Stop iPhone Data Thefts Now!","author":"Techlore","authorId":"UCs6KfncB4OV6Vug4o_bzijg","published":"","viewCount":5790,"lengthSeconds":515,"timeAdded":1677627572955,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"PfCSTvB_vJk","title":"-20C BITTER COLD Winter Night In A Snowy Log Cabin","author":"Baum Outdoors","authorId":"UCT6fVez_0DmaZ_WDaRhUw2A","published":"","viewCount":66866,"lengthSeconds":2495,"timeAdded":1677627573956,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"DLxWOpRO8_M","title":"Virus investigations - Mylobot Proxy Botnet","author":"Mental Outlaw","authorId":"UC7YOGHUfC1Tb6E4pudI9STA","published":"","viewCount":44013,"lengthSeconds":859,"timeAdded":1677627603530,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"-uByHarYeMQ","title":"Les rats des villes | ARTE","author":"ARTE","authorId":"UCwI-JbGNsojunnHbFAc0M4Q","published":"","viewCount":85271,"lengthSeconds":3150,"timeAdded":1677627621144,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"qlKx8uc_ppU","title":"Why is everything getting so expensive?","author":"Vox","authorId":"UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA","published":"","viewCount":680859,"lengthSeconds":586,"timeAdded":1677627635522,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"RorQRo-lMdo","title":"An AI That Generates Police Sketches - What Could Go Wrong?","author":"Mental Outlaw","authorId":"UC7YOGHUfC1Tb6E4pudI9STA","published":"","viewCount":55776,"lengthSeconds":777,"timeAdded":1677628056361,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"kJTXtDp8D0Q","title":"Stable Diffusion KLMC2!","author":"Nerdy Rodent","authorId":"UC4-5v-f-xKnbi1yaAuRSi_w","published":"","viewCount":16161,"lengthSeconds":524,"timeAdded":1678657270995,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"ro1gJY1ysqQ","title":"Instruct Pix2Pix - Edit Images with Text in Automatic1111!","author":"Nerdy Rodent","authorId":"UC4-5v-f-xKnbi1yaAuRSi_w","published":"","viewCount":11349,"lengthSeconds":591,"timeAdded":1678657272097,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"3q_9DS26qcw","title":"Mix up to 5 images with Stable Diffusion!","author":"Nerdy Rodent","authorId":"UC4-5v-f-xKnbi1yaAuRSi_w","published":"","viewCount":18574,"lengthSeconds":287,"timeAdded":1678657295095,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"1OBrZy8fVoc","title":"Karlo - replication of unCLIP, the DALL-E 2 technique!","author":"Nerdy Rodent","authorId":"UC4-5v-f-xKnbi1yaAuRSi_w","published":"","viewCount":8694,"lengthSeconds":584,"timeAdded":1678657302109,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"ldJ8WGZVXZk","title":"Introduction To Threads (pthreads) | C Programming Tutorial","author":"Portfolio Courses","authorId":"UC52tAgsocr9DgrPec_iw1eg","published":"","viewCount":20067,"lengthSeconds":819,"timeAdded":1678899236749,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"XDoxbQp1Dyw","title":"Lutter au quotidien pour s‚Äôen sortir  | ARTE Regards","author":"ARTE","authorId":"UCwI-JbGNsojunnHbFAc0M4Q","published":"","viewCount":71948,"lengthSeconds":1923,"timeAdded":1679005171917,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"v0XhFcDl69s","title":"Lirik plays Deceive Inc.

It handles folders, you can favorite files and folders to get back to them easily, you can tag anything you like, you can share anything either with selected people, or with a public link, you can even add comments to any file, and it supports versioning as well to restore older versions if you want.\n\n\nOn top of that, you can also mount that storage as webdav, in any good file manager. On Linux, with GNOME and KDE, this happens automatically when you configure a nextcloud account in the online accounts settings.\n\nAnd of course, you have a desktop client that lets you sync files either from a Nextcloud folder, or even from outside that folder, to make sure your files are where you want them.\n\nSyncthing isn't exactly cloud storage, it doesn't store files on a cloud server, it just syncs them from one computer to the other, in real time. So you setup syncthing on your laptop and your desktop, and it will send files back and forth between both devices, without any intermediary in between.\n\nIf you're already a ProtonMail customer, you might just want to look at Proton Drive.\n\nIt's an end to end encrypted solution, hosted in Switzerland, with relatively strong privacy laws, that don't really matter since everything is encrypted anyways, it's not like someone could look at what you stored, since files are encrypted on your device before being sent to the cloud.\n\nIt's also open source, and it obviously integrates well with the other Proton tools, like Mail or Calendar. Even though it's encrypted, you can still share files with others without file size limits, as well as password protect files, define expiration dates for links, and more.\n\nAnother open source alternative is Cozy Cloud. It's available for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS and Windows, and it gives you 5GB for free, with additional tiers at 50Gigs for 2 euros 99 per month, and 1TB for 9 euros 98. Still more expensive than Google, but also more private.\n\nIt also has auto import features from your phone camera roll to your drive, and can also automatically import certain documents from more than 100 providers, like your bills, health refunds, bank statements, and more, if you want.\n\npCloud is an option I used extensively in the past for all my cloud storage. It's not open source, but it has optional encryption features if you want to make sure that you're the only one that can look at your stuff. They're on the affordable side, with 500Gigs costing you 50 euros per year, or about 4 euros per month, and 2 terabytes for 100 euros a year, or a bit more than 8 euros per month.\n\nIf what you need is massive storage space and you don't want to self host, then I think Mega is your only option. Their base plans are more expensive than others, at 5 euros per month for 400 Gigs, but they can go up to 16Tb for 30 euros per month, which is a LOT of storage for not that much money, considering. The 2TB plan is on par with other options, at 10 euros per month.\n\nAnd I can't conclude this video without mentioning Zoho.

It handles folders, you can favorite files and folders to get back to them easily, you can tag anything you like, you can share anything either with selected people, or with a public link, you can even add comments to any file, and it supports versioning as well to restore older versions if you want.\n\n\nOn top of that, you can also mount that storage as webdav, in any good file manager. On Linux, with GNOME and KDE, this happens automatically when you configure a nextcloud account in the online accounts settings.\n\nAnd of course, you have a desktop client that lets you sync files either from a Nextcloud folder, or even from outside that folder, to make sure your files are where you want them.\n\nSyncthing isn't exactly cloud storage, it doesn't store files on a cloud server, it just syncs them from one computer to the other, in real time. So you setup syncthing on your laptop and your desktop, and it will send files back and forth between both devices, without any intermediary in between.\n\nIf you're already a ProtonMail customer, you might just want to look at Proton Drive.\n\nIt's an end to end encrypted solution, hosted in Switzerland, with relatively strong privacy laws, that don't really matter since everything is encrypted anyways, it's not like someone could look at what you stored, since files are encrypted on your device before being sent to the cloud.\n\nIt's also open source, and it obviously integrates well with the other Proton tools, like Mail or Calendar. Even though it's encrypted, you can still share files with others without file size limits, as well as password protect files, define expiration dates for links, and more.\n\nAnother open source alternative is Cozy Cloud. It's available for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS and Windows, and it gives you 5GB for free, with additional tiers at 50Gigs for 2 euros 99 per month, and 1TB for 9 euros 98. Still more expensive than Google, but also more private.\n\nIt also has auto import features from your phone camera roll to your drive, and can also automatically import certain documents from more than 100 providers, like your bills, health refunds, bank statements, and more, if you want.\n\npCloud is an option I used extensively in the past for all my cloud storage. It's not open source, but it has optional encryption features if you want to make sure that you're the only one that can look at your stuff. They're on the affordable side, with 500Gigs costing you 50 euros per year, or about 4 euros per month, and 2 terabytes for 100 euros a year, or a bit more than 8 euros per month.\n\nIf what you need is massive storage space and you don't want to self host, then I think Mega is your only option. Their base plans are more expensive than others, at 5 euros per month for 400 Gigs, but they can go up to 16Tb for 30 euros per month, which is a LOT of storage for not that much money, considering. The 2TB plan is on par with other options, at 10 euros per month.\n\nAnd I can't conclude this video without mentioning Zoho. If you don't really care all that much about privacy or open source, but you still want to ditch big tech, then Zoho is probably your best bet. they have replacements for EVERYTHING google does, and a lot more on top of that, and prices are relatively inexpensive.","viewCount":49602,"lengthSeconds":930,"timeAdded":1675625398641,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"SlooBN-qxiI","title":"High & Fines Herbes - Saison 4 - √âpisode 5 : Le sobeuhlier (avec Senamo, Di-meh, Youv Dee & Slimka)","author":"Caballero & JeanJass","authorId":"UCeg0PVLfsBKFLGd9V_EvbGA","published":"","viewCount":423093,"lengthSeconds":3332,"timeAdded":1677515265930,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"ReO9KD4QM_I","title":"5 lessons I learned in my early 20s (also, i moved!!)","author":"harshibar","authorId":"UCsp_z4KR3dOczXw7Q-SPqQg","published":"","viewCount":918,"lengthSeconds":513,"timeAdded":1677627540873,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"l9LQEHYr3AI","title":"The most useful Networking tool ever - Netcat","author":"Mark McNally","authorId":"UCMiInY8BhSUtCarO6uu6i_g","published":"","viewCount":99,"lengthSeconds":299,"timeAdded":1677627543733,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"zpcI_g_zrpk","title":"Why kids don‚Äôt get as cold as adults","author":"Vox","authorId":"UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA","published":"","viewCount":130085,"lengthSeconds":307,"timeAdded":1677627557859,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"nmNx1QqXpzM","title":"Lirik plays My Dream Setup","author":"waydong91","authorId":"UCebh6Np0l-DT9LXHrXbmopg","published":"","viewCount":2112,"lengthSeconds":1764,"timeAdded":1677627568206,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"25wG173PL3U","title":"Stop iPhone Data Thefts Now!","author":"Techlore","authorId":"UCs6KfncB4OV6Vug4o_bzijg","published":"","viewCount":5790,"lengthSeconds":515,"timeAdded":1677627572955,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"PfCSTvB_vJk","title":"-20C BITTER COLD Winter Night In A Snowy Log Cabin","author":"Baum Outdoors","authorId":"UCT6fVez_0DmaZ_WDaRhUw2A","published":"","viewCount":66866,"lengthSeconds":2495,"timeAdded":1677627573956,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"DLxWOpRO8_M","title":"Virus investigations - Mylobot Proxy Botnet","author":"Mental Outlaw","authorId":"UC7YOGHUfC1Tb6E4pudI9STA","published":"","viewCount":44013,"lengthSeconds":859,"timeAdded":1677627603530,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"-uByHarYeMQ","title":"Les rats des villes | ARTE","author":"ARTE","authorId":"UCwI-JbGNsojunnHbFAc0M4Q","published":"","viewCount":85271,"lengthSeconds":3150,"timeAdded":1677627621144,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"qlKx8uc_ppU","title":"Why is everything getting so expensive?","author":"Vox","authorId":"UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA","published":"","viewCount":680859,"lengthSeconds":586,"timeAdded":1677627635522,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"RorQRo-lMdo","title":"An AI That Generates Police Sketches - What Could Go Wrong?","author":"Mental Outlaw","authorId":"UC7YOGHUfC1Tb6E4pudI9STA","published":"","viewCount":55776,"lengthSeconds":777,"timeAdded":1677628056361,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"kJTXtDp8D0Q","title":"Stable Diffusion KLMC2!","author":"Nerdy Rodent","authorId":"UC4-5v-f-xKnbi1yaAuRSi_w","published":"","viewCount":16161,"lengthSeconds":524,"timeAdded":1678657270995,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"ro1gJY1ysqQ","title":"Instruct Pix2Pix - Edit Images with Text in Automatic1111!","author":"Nerdy Rodent","authorId":"UC4-5v-f-xKnbi1yaAuRSi_w","published":"","viewCount":11349,"lengthSeconds":591,"timeAdded":1678657272097,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"3q_9DS26qcw","title":"Mix up to 5 images with Stable Diffusion!","author":"Nerdy Rodent","authorId":"UC4-5v-f-xKnbi1yaAuRSi_w","published":"","viewCount":18574,"lengthSeconds":287,"timeAdded":1678657295095,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"1OBrZy8fVoc","title":"Karlo - replication of unCLIP, the DALL-E 2 technique!","author":"Nerdy Rodent","authorId":"UC4-5v-f-xKnbi1yaAuRSi_w","published":"","viewCount":8694,"lengthSeconds":584,"timeAdded":1678657302109,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"ldJ8WGZVXZk","title":"Introduction To Threads (pthreads) | C Programming Tutorial","author":"Portfolio Courses","authorId":"UC52tAgsocr9DgrPec_iw1eg","published":"","viewCount":20067,"lengthSeconds":819,"timeAdded":1678899236749,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"XDoxbQp1Dyw","title":"Lutter au quotidien pour s‚Äôen sortir  | ARTE Regards","author":"ARTE","authorId":"UCwI-JbGNsojunnHbFAc0M4Q","published":"","viewCount":71948,"lengthSeconds":1923,"timeAdded":1679005171917,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"v0XhFcDl69s","title":"Lirik plays Deceive Inc.

It handles folders, you can favorite files and folders to get back to them easily, you can tag anything you like, you can share anything either with selected people, or with a public link, you can even add comments to any file, and it supports versioning as well to restore older versions if you want.\n\n\nOn top of that, you can also mount that storage as webdav, in any good file manager. On Linux, with GNOME and KDE, this happens automatically when you configure a nextcloud account in the online accounts settings.\n\nAnd of course, you have a desktop client that lets you sync files either from a Nextcloud folder, or even from outside that folder, to make sure your files are where you want them.\n\nSyncthing isn't exactly cloud storage, it doesn't store files on a cloud server, it just syncs them from one computer to the other, in real time. So you setup syncthing on your laptop and your desktop, and it will send files back and forth between both devices, without any intermediary in between.\n\nIf you're already a ProtonMail customer, you might just want to look at Proton Drive.\n\nIt's an end to end encrypted solution, hosted in Switzerland, with relatively strong privacy laws, that don't really matter since everything is encrypted anyways, it's not like someone could look at what you stored, since files are encrypted on your device before being sent to the cloud.\n\nIt's also open source, and it obviously integrates well with the other Proton tools, like Mail or Calendar. Even though it's encrypted, you can still share files with others without file size limits, as well as password protect files, define expiration dates for links, and more.\n\nAnother open source alternative is Cozy Cloud. It's available for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS and Windows, and it gives you 5GB for free, with additional tiers at 50Gigs for 2 euros 99 per month, and 1TB for 9 euros 98. Still more expensive than Google, but also more private.\n\nIt also has auto import features from your phone camera roll to your drive, and can also automatically import certain documents from more than 100 providers, like your bills, health refunds, bank statements, and more, if you want.\n\npCloud is an option I used extensively in the past for all my cloud storage. It's not open source, but it has optional encryption features if you want to make sure that you're the only one that can look at your stuff. They're on the affordable side, with 500Gigs costing you 50 euros per year, or about 4 euros per month, and 2 terabytes for 100 euros a year, or a bit more than 8 euros per month.\n\nIf what you need is massive storage space and you don't want to self host, then I think Mega is your only option. Their base plans are more expensive than others, at 5 euros per month for 400 Gigs, but they can go up to 16Tb for 30 euros per month, which is a LOT of storage for not that much money, considering. The 2TB plan is on par with other options, at 10 euros per month.\n\nAnd I can't conclude this video without mentioning Zoho. If you don't really care all that much about privacy or open source, but you still want to ditch big tech, then Zoho is probably your best bet. they have replacements for EVERYTHING google does, and a lot more on top of that, and prices are relatively inexpensive.","viewCount":49602,"lengthSeconds":930,"timeAdded":1675625398641,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"SlooBN-qxiI","title":"High & Fines Herbes - Saison 4 - √âpisode 5 : Le sobeuhlier (avec Senamo, Di-meh, Youv Dee & Slimka)","author":"Caballero & JeanJass","authorId":"UCeg0PVLfsBKFLGd9V_EvbGA","published":"","viewCount":423093,"lengthSeconds":3332,"timeAdded":1677515265930,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"ReO9KD4QM_I","title":"5 lessons I learned in my early 20s (also, i moved!!)","author":"harshibar","authorId":"UCsp_z4KR3dOczXw7Q-SPqQg","published":"","viewCount":918,"lengthSeconds":513,"timeAdded":1677627540873,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"l9LQEHYr3AI","title":"The most useful Networking tool ever - Netcat","author":"Mark McNally","authorId":"UCMiInY8BhSUtCarO6uu6i_g","published":"","viewCount":99,"lengthSeconds":299,"timeAdded":1677627543733,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"zpcI_g_zrpk","title":"Why kids don‚Äôt get as cold as adults","author":"Vox","authorId":"UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA","published":"","viewCount":130085,"lengthSeconds":307,"timeAdded":1677627557859,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"nmNx1QqXpzM","title":"Lirik plays My Dream Setup","author":"waydong91","authorId":"UCebh6Np0l-DT9LXHrXbmopg","published":"","viewCount":2112,"lengthSeconds":1764,"timeAdded":1677627568206,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"25wG173PL3U","title":"Stop iPhone Data Thefts Now!","author":"Techlore","authorId":"UCs6KfncB4OV6Vug4o_bzijg","published":"","viewCount":5790,"lengthSeconds":515,"timeAdded":1677627572955,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"PfCSTvB_vJk","title":"-20C BITTER COLD Winter Night In A Snowy Log Cabin","author":"Baum Outdoors","authorId":"UCT6fVez_0DmaZ_WDaRhUw2A","published":"","viewCount":66866,"lengthSeconds":2495,"timeAdded":1677627573956,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"DLxWOpRO8_M","title":"Virus investigations - Mylobot Proxy Botnet","author":"Mental Outlaw","authorId":"UC7YOGHUfC1Tb6E4pudI9STA","published":"","viewCount":44013,"lengthSeconds":859,"timeAdded":1677627603530,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"-uByHarYeMQ","title":"Les rats des villes | ARTE","author":"ARTE","authorId":"UCwI-JbGNsojunnHbFAc0M4Q","published":"","viewCount":85271,"lengthSeconds":3150,"timeAdded":1677627621144,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"qlKx8uc_ppU","title":"Why is everything getting so expensive?","author":"Vox","authorId":"UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA","published":"","viewCount":680859,"lengthSeconds":586,"timeAdded":1677627635522,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"RorQRo-lMdo","title":"An AI That Generates Police Sketches - What Could Go Wrong?","author":"Mental Outlaw","authorId":"UC7YOGHUfC1Tb6E4pudI9STA","published":"","viewCount":55776,"lengthSeconds":777,"timeAdded":1677628056361,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"kJTXtDp8D0Q","title":"Stable Diffusion KLMC2!","author":"Nerdy Rodent","authorId":"UC4-5v-f-xKnbi1yaAuRSi_w","published":"","viewCount":16161,"lengthSeconds":524,"timeAdded":1678657270995,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"ro1gJY1ysqQ","title":"Instruct Pix2Pix - Edit Images with Text in Automatic1111!","author":"Nerdy Rodent","authorId":"UC4-5v-f-xKnbi1yaAuRSi_w","published":"","viewCount":11349,"lengthSeconds":591,"timeAdded":1678657272097,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"3q_9DS26qcw","title":"Mix up to 5 images with Stable Diffusion!","author":"Nerdy Rodent","authorId":"UC4-5v-f-xKnbi1yaAuRSi_w","published":"","viewCount":18574,"lengthSeconds":287,"timeAdded":1678657295095,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"1OBrZy8fVoc","title":"Karlo - replication of unCLIP, the DALL-E 2 technique!","author":"Nerdy Rodent","authorId":"UC4-5v-f-xKnbi1yaAuRSi_w","published":"","viewCount":8694,"lengthSeconds":584,"timeAdded":1678657302109,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"ldJ8WGZVXZk","title":"Introduction To Threads (pthreads) | C Programming Tutorial","author":"Portfolio Courses","authorId":"UC52tAgsocr9DgrPec_iw1eg","published":"","viewCount":20067,"lengthSeconds":819,"timeAdded":1678899236749,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"XDoxbQp1Dyw","title":"Lutter au quotidien pour s‚Äôen sortir  | ARTE Regards","author":"ARTE","authorId":"UCwI-JbGNsojunnHbFAc0M4Q","published":"","viewCount":71948,"lengthSeconds":1923,"timeAdded":1679005171917,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video"},{"videoId":"v0XhFcDl69s","title":"Lirik plays Deceive Inc.
